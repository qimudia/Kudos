# Kudos
For this assignment, I built a Tiny Improvements application, an app that allows users to send compliments or "Kudos" to other users that are then displayed on the page for all to see.
 
How to use:
Click on “View Kudos” to view all kudos..
Click on “Give Kudos” to give kudos..
I wasn’t able to post kudos from my web page, but was able to post a few using the Postman…
